# Predicting Stock Market Crashes: A Comprehensive Analysis Using Economic Variables

## Introduction

- Overview of stock market crashes:
A stock market crash is a sudden and significant decline in the value of a stock market, typically characterized by a drop of 10% or more in a major index such as the S&P 500 over a short period. These events can be triggered by a variety of factors, including economic downturns, political instability, natural disasters, or sudden shifts in investor sentiment.
- Importance of predicting crashes
Predicting stock market crashes is of paramount importance for various stakeholders, including investors, financial institutions, policymakers, and the broader economy. Understanding the potential for market downturns can lead to more informed decision-making and proactive measures that can mitigate adverse effects.
- Brief explanation of the S&P 500 index
The S&P 500, or Standard & Poor's 500, is a stock market index that measures the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. It is regarded as one of the best representations of the U.S. stock market and a key indicator of the overall health of the economy.

## Economic Variables

### GDP (Gross Domestic Product)
- **Definition and significance**
GDP is a measure of a country's economic activity, which is the total value of goods and services produced within a country minus the value of the goods and services used to produce them.
- Historical correlation with stock market performance

### Inflation
- **Definition and impact on purchasing power**
Inflation is the rate of increase in prices over a given period of time. Inflation is typically a broad measure, such as the overall increase in prices or the increase in the cost of living in a country.
